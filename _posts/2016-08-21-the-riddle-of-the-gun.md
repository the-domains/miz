  Fantasists and zealots can be found on both sides of the debate over guns in
  America. On the one hand, many gun-rights advocates reject even the most
  sensible restrictions on the sale of weapons to the public. On the other,
  proponents of stricter gun laws often seem unable to understand why a good
  person would ever want ready access to a loaded firearm.
