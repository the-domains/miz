  There is the language adults use with each other and the language they use
  with children, which, in linguistics, is known as "child-directed" or
  "caretaker" speech. Caretaker speech obeys a separate grammar from adult
  speech, with diminutive inflections and suffixes. It might have doggy-woggy in
  place of dog, or hammy instead of hamster.
