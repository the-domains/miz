  Below is a list of core values commonly used by leadership institutes and
  programs. This list is not exhaustive, but it will give you an idea of some
  common core values (also called personal values). My recommendation is to
  select less than five core values to focus on-if everything is a core value,
  then nothing is really a priority.
