  Costco made headlines when it announced its split from American Express and
  its new relationship with Citi and Visa, which launches in June. It's a big
  deal, mostly because the warehouse giant has had an exclusive relationship
  with AmEx for more than 16 years, offering its more than 80 million shoppers
  co-branded credit cards that can be used anywhere and earn special rewards for
  Costco purchases.
